# Kosaraju's Algorithm Algorithm
#
# Kosaraju's algorithm (also known as the Kosarajuâ€“Sharir algorithm) is a 
# linear time algorithm to find the strongly connected components of a 
# directed graph. It makes use of the fact that the transpose graph (the 
# same graph with the direction of every edge reversed) has exactly the 
# same strongly connected components as the original graph. 
#
# Complexity analysis
# Provided the graph is described using an adjacency list, Kosaraju's algorithm 
# performs two complete traversals of the graph and so runs in O(V + E) (linear) time.
# If the graph is represented as an adjacency matrix, the algorithm requires O(V^2) time.
