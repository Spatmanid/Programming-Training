# Kruskal's Algorithm
#
# Given a connected and undirected graph, a spanning tree of that graph is a subgraph 
# that is a tree and connects all the vertices together. A single graph can have many 
# different spanning trees. A minimum spanning tree (MST) or minimum weight spanning 
# tree for a weighted, connected and undirected graph is a spanning tree with weight 
# less than or equal to the weight of every other spanning tree. The weight of a 
# spanning tree is the sum of weights given to each edge of the spanning tree.
#
#    1. Sort all the edges in non-decreasing order of their weight.
#    2. Pick the smallest edge. Check if it forms a cycle (Union-Find) 
#       with the spanning tree formed so far. If cycle is not formed, 
#       include this edge. Else, discard it.
#    3. Repeat step 2 until there are (ùëâ‚àí1) edges in the spanning tree.
#
# Complexity analysis
# The time complexity of this algorithm is O(E logE) or O(E logV), where V is the number of
# vertices in the graph and E the number of edges. Sorting of edges takes O(E log E) time. 
# After sorting, we iterate through all edges and apply find-union algorithm. The find and 
# union operations can take atmost O(logV) time. So overall complexity is O(E logE + E logV) 
# time. The value of E can be atmost O(V^2), so O(logV) and O(logE) are same. Therefore, 
# overall time complexity is O(E logE) or O(E logV).
# The space complexity is O(E + V).
