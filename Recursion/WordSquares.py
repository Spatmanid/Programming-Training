############### Word Squares ###############
# Given a set of words (without duplicates), find all word squares you can build from them.
# A sequence of words forms a valid word square if the kth row and column read the exact same string, where 0 â‰¤ k < max(numRows, # numColumns).
# For example, the word sequence ["ball","area","lead","lady"] forms a word square because each word reads the same both 
# horizontally and vertically.
# 
#   b a l l
#   a r e a
#   l e a d
#   l a d y
#
# Note:
#   There are at least 1 and at most 1000 words.
#   All words will have the exact same length.
#   Word length is at least 1 and at most 5.
#   Each word contains only lowercase English alphabet a-z.
