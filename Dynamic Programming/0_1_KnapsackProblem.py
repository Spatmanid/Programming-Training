############### 0-1 Knapsack Problem ###############
# Given weights and values of n items, put these items in a knapsack of capacity W to get the maximum total value in the 
# knapsack. In other words, given two integer arrays val[0..n-1] and wt[0..n-1] which represent values and weights associated
# with n items respectively. Also given an integer W which represents knapsack capacity, find out the maximum value subset of 
# val[] such that sum of the weights of this subset is smaller than or equal to W. You cannot break an item, either pick the
# complete item, or donâ€™t pick it (0-1 property).
#
# Example
# Input: val = [60, 100, 120]
#         wt = [10, 20, 30]
#         W = 50
# Output: 220
#
# Complexity Analysis
# Time: O(N * W), where N = # of items and C = knapsack capacity.
# Space: O(N * C). We can further improve our bottom-up DP solution to have O(C) space complexity.

                    dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j]
                else:
                    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], val[i-1] + dp[i-1][j - wt[i-1]])

                    dp[i%2][j] = max(dp[(i-1)%2][j], val[i-1] + dp[(i-1)%2][j - wt[i-1]])
